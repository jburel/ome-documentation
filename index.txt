Introduction to OMERO.scripts
============================= 

OMERO.scripts are the OME version of plugins, allowing you to extend the 
functionality of your OMERO installation.

The :javadoc:`OMERO scripting service API <slice2html/omero/api/IScript.html>` 
allows Python scripts to be uploaded to an OMERO.server so that image 
processing and analysis, and other functionality, can be carried out on the 
server rather than your local machine. Scripts can be run from the OMERO 
clients, using a UI generated from the script and the results should also be 
handled by OMERO.insight or OMERO.web where relevant e.g. allowing users to 
view OMERO Images or Datasets created by the script, or download files or 
images.

Finding scripts
---------------

Core scripts are bundled with every OMERO.server release and automatically 
available to all users. You can find additional scripts via the new 
:community_plone:`script sharing <scripts>` page.

Writing scripts
---------------

:doc:`user-guide` describes the workflows for developing and running your own 
scripts, depending on whether you have admin rights to your OMERO.server or 
not. You should use the :doc:`style-guide` to ensure your script interacts the 
OMERO clients in a usable way.

Installing and running scripts
------------------------------

The easiest way to make use of scripts is for someone with admin rights to 
upload them to the OMERO.server as described in the 'script writing as Admin' 
section in the :doc:`user-guide`. Once a script has been added under the 
lib/scripts directory, you can run them from the OMERO clients or the command 
line.

If this is not possible, you can install scripts to run locally on the same 
machine as your client using the 'regular user workflow' described in the 
:doc:`user-guide`.

Managing scripts
----------------

To keep your scripts up to date even when your server is upgraded, we 
recommend you use a Github repository to manage your scripts. If you are not 
familiar with :doc:`/developers/using-git`, you can use the 
`Github app for your OS <http://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git>`_ 
(available for Mac and Windows). The basic workflow is:

-  fork our 
   `omero-user-script <https://github.com/joshmoore/omero-user-scripts>`_ 
   repository
-  clone it in your lib/scripts directory

   ::

           cd lib/scripts; 
           git clone git@github.com:YOURGITUSERNAME/omero-user-scripts.git YOUR_SCRIPTS

-  save the scripts you want to use into the appropriate sub-directory in your 
   cloned location lib/scripts/YOUR_SCRIPTS

Contributing back to the community
----------------------------------

If you have modified one of the core scripts or developed your own that you 
would like to contribute back to the community, please get in touch. We 
can either add your repository to the list on the 
:community_plone:`script sharing <scripts>` page so people can find it, or if 
the script is likely to have wide appeal, we can look into adding it to the 
core scripts that are distributed with an OMERO release.
